# Fair Play App

This app was made with the intent to keep kids sports substitutions as fair as possible.

Input non duplicate names into the roster and click lineup to make a lineup. The app assumes a lineup size of 5. Each lineup with the exception of the first takes into account the number of times a player has played, whether or not they just played, and if they are active or inactive.

## Features

-   Undo the last lineup
-   Mark players as active or inactive
    -   When marked inactive the app checks whether the game is currently being played, and substitutes the appropriate player

## Technical Details

This was created with HTML, CSS, and javascript. Vite was used only as a developer convenience. See the code for further detail.
